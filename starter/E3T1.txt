# Describe GuardDuty findings that were detected related to the brute force attack 

"UnauthorizedAccess:EC2/SSHBruteForce" was listed as the finding with this self-explanatory description "This finding informs you that an EC2 instance in your AWS environment was involved in a brute force attack aimed at obtaining passwords to SSH services on Linux-based systems. This can indicate unauthorized access to your AWS resources". 

  
# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information. 

Researching via the Amazon GuardDuty User Guide provided information about GuardDuty data sources. GuardDuty was able to detect this particular attack via VPC flow logs as explained in Section "Data sources/VPC Flow Logs" on page 14. The flow logs contain information covering IP traffic going to and coming from network interfaces within my AWS environment. From this information, it was able to detect the SSH Brute Force attack.
